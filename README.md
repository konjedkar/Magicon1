This code is intended to program a AT90CAN128 based elevator controller mianboard. It used to be working properly on a commercial project as a core program. It needs some other boards to be completed such as cabin remote board which is installed in an inspection box. Therefore you can't use this program to implement a running project of elevator but you can still get many ideas.

Although this project is not in use, most parts of the algorithm have been deployed to the existing product.

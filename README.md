This code is intended to program a AT90CAN128 based elevator controller mianboard. It used to be working properly on a commercial project as a core program. It needs some other boards to be completed such as cabin remote board which is installed in an inspection box. Therefore you can't use this program to implement a running project of elevator but yu can still get many ideas.

Althpugh this project is legacy, most parts of the algorithm havr been employed in the existing product.

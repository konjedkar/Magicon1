    Use [u]intN_t if you need exactly N bits.

    Since these typedefs are mandated by the C99 standard, they are preferred
    over rolling your own typedefs.

    \note If avr-gcc's \c -mint8 option is used, no 32-bit types will be
    available.

    \todo There is a pending patch that may go into gcc to change the
    behaviour of the -mint8 option.  The current (2003-09-17) situation for
    -mint8 is sizeof(int) == 1, sizeof(long) == 2 and sizeof(long long) == 8.
    Note the absence of a 4-byte, 32-bit type.  The patch proposes to change
    sozeof(long long) to be 4 bytes (32 bits).  When and if the patch is
    included in gcc, we will need to change avr-libc accordingly.  */
